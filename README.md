# Burger-Shack-

This is a food delivery application called "Burger Shack" and this allows users to pick foods and have them delivered to their address. The user will be in the homepage 
and will be presented with a navigation bar, a menu with specific options, and a footer. The user can first sign up and after signing up, they are logged into the Burger
Shack website and are able to start adding items into their cart. The user is able to click on items they want to add to the cart and once they finish, they can click 
on the cart icon and start checking out. They are then prompted to enter their credit card credentials and once they are done, the food will be delivered to the address
they wrote down when they created their account. Also, their order history are recorded where they can view what they have bought.
